# The Atem Programming Language

## Introduction

Atem is a minimalist, general-purpose programming language focusing on providing a fine-grained powerful metaprogramming system.

Atem is originally based on the "freedom of programming paradigms" provided by C++ metaprogramming system, and it also takes inspirations from many other languages like [Cpp2](https://github.com/hsutter/cppfront), [Circle](circle-lang.org), [Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Swift](https://www.swift.org/documentation/), [D](https://dlang.org/) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/).
